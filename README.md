> Lionel's Weekend is a game made for the 39th Ludum Dare, for the theme "Running out of power".

### Description

You are Lionel. You work at the warehouse. This is Friday, and someone asked you to "move this box over there, please". Well.  
It looks like a %$#! colleague forgot you were here. Or was it on purpose?!

### How to Play

Space bar to jump, arrow keys to walk / climb the ladders.  
The **sound is important** in this game, so turn on the sound (even better with headset on!).  
Try to **remember or anticipate the path** you took or will take, and use the sound to understand your environment!
